 <h2>Learn about referendums!</h2>
<h3>What are referendums?</h3>
<p>A referendum is when the citizenry vote on a piece of legislation that has been passed by the legislation. This 'veto' power allows for citizens to have a greater say in their government. However, referendums only work if they are brought to ballot by dedicated individuals and volunteers who collect the necessary signatures. </p>
<h3>What's an example of a referendum?</h3>
<p>Referendums can veto unpopular bills. For example, if a legislature tries to pass a very partisan district map, then the people can step in to veto it on the ballot. The referendum is a very powerful tool to keep government accountable.</p>
 <h3>How do I create a referendum?</h3>
 <p>A referendum needs a certain number of signatures to be placed on the ballot. You can learn all the details about gathering those signatures on our <a href="signatures.html">signatures</a> page.</p>
 <h3>What can I do on this website?</h3>
<p>You can learn how to make your own referendum, look at our list of current petitions and submit your own, and use our maps to volunteer to sign petitions or to find other volunteers.</p>
 <h3>What should I do now?</h3>
 <p>First, look at the <a href="signatures.html">signatures</a> page to learn about creating your own petition. If you would rather sign other petitions, you can put your location on our interactive <a href="map.html">map</a>.</p>
