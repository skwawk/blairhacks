The Maryland Constitution forbids the use of the veto referendum power on any law "making any appropriation for maintaining the State Government, or for maintaining or aiding any public institution, not exceeding the next previous appropriation for the same purpose." In other words, the continuation of basic appropriations to meet the state's budget cannot be put to a vote through a signature petition. Increases to appropriations made in the past, however, are subject to the referendum power.

Moreover, the constitution declares, "No law, licensing, regulating, prohibiting, or submitting to local option, the manufacture or sale of malt or spirituous liquors, shall be referred or repealed under the provisions of this Article."

Starting a petition
Applying to petition
A draft of the petition form should be submitted prior to circulation to receive approval or technical suggestions from the state board of elections.

Petition summary
The form of the petition for a veto referendum is set out by state law. The petition must contain (1) an information sheet and (2) the signature sheets.

The information sheet must contain:

a description of the purpose of the petition
identification of the sponsor of the petition
summary information about the signatures contained in the petition
an affidavit as to the validity of the petition
Each signature sheet must contain:

a description of the purpose of the petition
a fair and accurate summary of the bill or parts of a bill targeted by the referendum or the full text of the targeted law
a statement to which each signer subscribes saying that the signer supports the purpose of the petition and is a registered voter in the county specified

Collecting signatures
Each initiative and referendum state employs a unique method of calculating the state's signature requirements. Some states mandate a certain fraction of registered voters while others base their calculation on those who actually voted in a preceding election. In addition, many states employ a distribution requirement, dictating where in the state these signatures must be collected. Beyond these overarching requirements, many states regulate the manner in which signatures may be collected and the timeline for collecting them.

Number required
For a veto referendum on a statewide law, valid signatures equal to 3 percent of votes cast for governor in the most recent gubernatorial election must be collected. For a referendum on a local law, signatures must equal 10 percent of votes last cast for governor in the affected jurisdiction.

The chart below shows election years and the signature requirement for statewide veto referendums designed to appear on the ballot in that year, from 2012 to the present, with gubernatorial election years bolded.

Year	Statewide referendum signature requirement
2018	51,996
2016	51,996
2014	55,736
2012	55,736
Distribution requirements

Of the signatures required to qualify a veto referendum question for the ballot, not more than half can be from residents of Baltimore City or any one county.

Restrictions on circulators
Affidavit

See also: Circulator affidavit
Attached to each signature petition sheet, an affidavit signed by the circulator must state, "that the signatures were affixed in his (/her) presence and that, based upon the person's best knowledge and belief, every signature on the paper is genuine and bona fide and that the signers are registered voters at the address set opposite or below their names."

Who may sign
Qualified electors of the state are permitted to sign a referendum petition.

Electronic signatures
See also: Electronic petition signatures
Since electronic signatures are an emerging technology, the constitutionality of bans on e-signatures and the legality of e-signatures in states without bans is largely untested. Maryland law does require petitioners to sign an affidavit stating that all signatures were affixed to the petition in his or her presence.

Deadlines for collection
Signatures for a referendum petition against a legislative bill must be collected after the bill has been approved by the legislature.

Unless a bill is approved by a three-fifths supermajority in the legislature and labeled as an emergency bill, all bills passed by the legislature go into effect on the first day of June in the year following the legislative session in which the bill was passed.

For non-emergency bills, at least one-third of the required signatures, which amounts to a number equal to 1 percent of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election, must be filed with the secretary of state by the first of June on which the bill would have gone into effect. If this is accomplished, petitioners have until June 30 to turn in the remaining two-thirds of the required signatures.

For emergency bills or bills passed less than 45 days before June 1, referendum petitioners have until 30 days after the bill is passed by the legislature to turn in the first one-third of required signatures. If this is accomplished, they have 30 more days to collect and submit the remaining two-thirds of the signatures.

Withdrawal
Up until the petition is filed, any signer can have his signature removed from the petition "upon written application to" the secretary of state.
