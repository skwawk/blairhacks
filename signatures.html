<h2>Referendum</h2>
  <h4>Source: <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Laws_governing_the_referendum_process_in_Maryland">Ballotpedia</a></h4>
<p>In Maryland, voters can create referendums to veto laws passed by their legislature, such as overly partisan redistrictings.</p>
  <h3>Restrictions</h3>
  <p>The Maryland Constitution restricts using the veto referendum on laws regarding the sale or manufacturing or on budget laws that don't just increase previous allocations.</p>
  
  <h3>Applying to petition</h3>
<p>A draft of the petition form should be submitted prior to circulation to receive approval or technical suggestions from the state board of elections.</p>

  <h3>Petition documents</h3>
<p>A petition must contain an information sheet as well as the signature sheets. <br />

The information sheet must contain:<br />
  <ul>
<li>a description of the purpose of the petition</li>
<li>identification of the sponsor of the petition</li>
<li>summary information about the signatures contained in the petition</li>
<li>an affidavit as to the validity of the petition</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
Each signature sheet must contain: <br />
<ul>
<li>a description of the purpose of the petition</li>
<li>a fair and accurate summary of the bill or parts of a bill targeted by the referendum or the full text of the targeted law</li>
<li>a statement to which each signer subscribes saying that the signer supports the purpose of the petition and is a registered voter in the county specified</li>
<li>a space for the signer's signature and required information, including: 
  <ul>
    <li>the signer's name and signature</li>
    <li>the date of signing</li>
    <li>the signer's address</li>
    <li>the county in which the signer is registered to vote</li>
    <li>a circulator affidavit</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Requirements</h3>
To veto a Maryland law, you must collect a number of signatures equal to 3 percent of the votes cast for governor in the last gubernatorial election. 
  For 2018, the requirement is 51,996 votes.<br />
Not more than half of those signatures can be from the same county (or Baltimore City).<br />


<h3>Affidavit</h3>
The following affidavit must be signed by the circulator and attatched to the petition sheet: "the signatures were affixed in his (/her) presence and that, based upon the person's best knowledge and belief, every signature on the paper is genuine and bona fide and that the signers are registered voters at the address set opposite or below their names." <br />
  Currently, this affidavit means electronic signatures are not valid in Maryland.
 
  <h3>Collection Deadlines</h3>
Signatures for a referendum petition against a legislative bill must be collected after the bill has been approved by the legislature.
<br />
Unless a bill is approved by a three-fifths supermajority in the legislature and labeled as an emergency bill, all bills passed by the legislature go into effect on the first day of June in the year following the legislative session in which the bill was passed.
<br />
For non-emergency bills, at least one-third of the required signatures, which amounts to a number equal to 1 percent of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election, must be filed with the secretary of state by the first of June on which the bill would have gone into effect. If this is accomplished, petitioners have until June 30 to turn in the remaining two-thirds of the required signatures.
<br />
For emergency bills or bills passed less than 45 days before June 1, referendum petitioners have until 30 days after the bill is passed by the legislature to turn in the first one-third of required signatures. If this is accomplished, they have 30 more days to collect and submit the remaining two-thirds of the signatures.


  <h3>Withdrawal</h3>
Up until the petition is filed, any signer can have his signature removed from the petition "upon written application to" the secretary of state.
